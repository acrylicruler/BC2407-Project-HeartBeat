# Project HeartBeat: Predictive Analytics for Cardiovascular Health

This repository houses the predictive models and analysis for Project HeartBeat, an initiative to address cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in Singapore and globally. Utilising the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), our project develops and evaluates predictive models to assess CVD risk factors. We explore Logistic Regression, CART, neural network and random forest, ultimately implementing logistic regression for its optimal performance. The repository includes exploratory data analysis, model comparison, and the final model integration into the Cardiac Health Monitoring and Prediction (CHAMP) application. Our findings assist the National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) in enhancing operational efficiency, improving early CVD detection, and delivering educational resources for better health management.
